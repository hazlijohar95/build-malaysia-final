# Build Malaysia - Project Documentation

## Project Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY

### Project Overview
Build Malaysia is a complete pixel-perfect recreation of extraordinary.com, adapted for Malaysia's extraordinary talent ecosystem. The project showcases Malaysian professionals and provides pathways for talent to contribute to nation-building.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Router v7 (Remix)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4 with custom design system
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Build Tool**: Vite v6 with optimized bundling
- **Fonts**: System font stack (no custom fonts)

## Bash Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production
- `npm run start`: Start production server
- `npm run typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checker
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint code linting

## Code Standards

### Style Guidelines
